<h1>Classes and Objects in Java</h1>

<p>In Java, classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, similar to their counterparts in C++.</p>

<h2>Classes: Blueprints of Objects</h2>

<p>Classes serve as templates for objects. They define the variables and behaviors that objects of their type will possess. For instance, in the program I wrote, I used the <code>Computer</code> class to specify attributes such as <code>processor</code>, <code>RAM</code>, and <code>hard drive</code> for computers. To maintain clarity and organization, I created a separate file (<a href="link-to-your-repository/Computer.java">Computer.java</a>) to encapsulate the <code>Computer</code> class and its definitions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Classes can have private and public variables. Private variables ensure data integrity by restricting direct access.</li>
  <li><strong>Constructors:</strong> Java provides a default constructor, but you can customize it to suit specific needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Getters and Setters:</strong> These methods allow controlled access to private variables. In my program, I've used getter methods to retrieve information about computers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objects: Instances of Classes</h2>

<p>Objects are specific instances created from a class. They inherit the variables, constructors, and methods defined by their parent class. For example, in a hypothetical car lot scenario discussed in a lecture, each car would be an object with unique properties like color, model, make, and year.</p>

<p>In my program, I've chosen computers as examples to illustrate the concepts of classes and objects. The <code>Computer</code> class defines three private variables: <code>processor</code>, <code>RAM</code>, and <code>hard drive</code>. This minimal set of attributes is sufficient to demonstrate the relationship between classes and objects.</p>
